        I love what I do because I truly care about the clients. The fulfillment goes far beyond any salary. The respect that my children have for the work I’ve done is so rewarding. So many people depend on the aides, family members that work need you there on time. Clients that are bedbound. I CAN GO ON AND ON. I really miss it. Sometimes just going in with the right spirit... and a smile means so much to the clients.

        <p>Although I work in the health care industry, I’m not that confident when it comes to choosing my benefits. I usually end up enrolling in whatever's cheapest. But benefits are expensive and I want to make a smart choice. After looking at my options, I’m going with the Core PPO. I know the <a href="glossary.asp#premium">premiums</a> for the High Deductible Health Plan are lower, but my husband has asthma and needs to see the doctor pretty often. And we both take a couple of ongoing prescriptions. We don’t have a lot of room in our budget for unpredictable expenses so I like knowing that doctors’ office visits and prescriptions are covered by a <a href="glossary.asp#copayment">copayment</a>.</p>
        <p>I’m also enrolling in the Health Care FSA. That way I can save money on our copayments because the money I contribute to my account comes out of my paycheck before taxes. In our tax bracket, that’s about a 15% savings on things I’d be paying for anyway.</p>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Between work and family responsibilities, there’s a lot on my plate—including finding quality health care coverage at a reasonable cost. It’s also important to me to find as many ways to save on taxes as possible. (<em>Why spend money I don’t have to</em>?) And with retirement getting closer, I’m always on the lookout for ways to save more for my future.</p>
        <p>After <a href="more-than-30/medical.asp#high-deductible">learning more about the High Deductible Health Plan</a>, I think it’s the best deal for me. The <a href="glossary.asp#premium">premiums</a> are lower than either of the PPO options. We don’t use a lot of health care services. So even though the deductible is higher than the PPOs, with the money I’m saving on premiums, I think I’ll still come out ahead.</p>
        <p>I’m definitely signing up for the Health Savings Account (HSA). The money I save comes out of my check before taxes—so I pay taxes on a lower amount. And I can use the money to pay for expenses (tax free), leave it in my account to grow (earning interest), or a combination. The money in my account is always mine—even if I retire or change jobs. Because of all the tax breaks, the HSA is also a great way to save for retirement expenses.</p>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>I work a couple of jobs to make ends meet. On my salary, health insurance feels like something I can’t afford. I avoid going to the doctor, but last year, I had chest pains and had to go to the ER. Turns out I have high blood pressure. The hospital bill was really high and I missed two days of work. They gave me a prescription that I’m supposed to take every day, but I can’t afford it.</p>
        <p>I heard that the IRS is going to charge almost $700 if I don’t have health coverage. And if I sign up for one of the BAYADA health plans, I won't have to pay the penalty. So I’m going to check out the BAYADA Minimum Coverage Plan. I heard the plan includes free telephone or online care from a real doctor. I could use that next time one of us gets sick. It also gives discounts on prescriptions, so maybe I <em>could</em> afford to fill my blood pressure medication.</p>
        <p>I also asked my daughter to check out the Obamacare options in the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/" target="_blank">health insurance marketplace</a>. There are a couple of free services—<a href="http://healthsherpa.com" target="_blank">HealthSherpa</a> and <a href="https://choosemylo.com/" target="_blank">Mylo</a>—that can help. She said she’d also look to see if we qualify for <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/" target="_blank">Medicaid</a> and/or the <a href="https://www.insurekidsnow.gov/" target="_blank">Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</a>.</p>
        <p>For the first time ever, I'm confident that we’re going to have health care coverage.</p>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>I know I need health insurance. It’s the law, and it’s important to have in case we get sick. But between the <a href="glossary.asp#premium">premiums</a>—and the costs to see a doctor or get a prescription—it all really adds up.</p>
        <p>I didn’t enroll in coverage at my last job because I didn’t think I could afford it. But as the penalty for not having coverage keeps going up, I’m rethinking that decision. Plus, as a single mom, I can’t really afford to get sick and miss work. The Enhanced Minimum Coverage Plan pays for annual checkups, which helps to keep me healthy. And If I do get sick, I can get free 24/7 care from a doctor right over the phone.</p>
        <p>I’m also checking out the <a href="https://www.insurekidsnow.gov/" target="_blank">Children’s Health Insurance Plan</a> to see if I can get low-cost coverage for my kids.</p>
