                        What is <span class="italics">The BAYADA Way</span>?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        <span class="italics">The BAYADA Way</span> is our company philosophy. It expresses the values and beliefs that have been the foundation of our work since 1975.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2002, Mark Baiada, the founder and president of BAYADA Home Health Care, set out to formally identify and articulate the company's mission, vision and values. With the help of Dr. Al Freedman, a psychologist and parent of a BAYADA client, he solicited input from thousands of clients, family members, and employees. Over time, <span class="italics">The BAYADA Way</span> emerged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We invite you to read <span class="italics">The BAYADA Way</span> but perhaps the best way to understand it is in the <a href="bayada-stories.asp">stories</a> of our clients, families, and caregivers. Our clients see <span class="italics">The BAYADA Way</span> in the high quality of care they receive, and they feel it in the respect and compassion our BAYADA caregivers show them.
