                                                The term “home health care” describes a wide range of health care services that can be provided in your home. There are many reasons why people may need care at home. Some are recovering from surgery, or have a chronic condition or disability that requires ongoing care. Others need certain therapies or could use some assistance with activities of daily living. BAYADA Home Health Care provides these services to children and adults of all ages.

                            <p>Prior to starting care, a BAYADA Pediatrics Clinical Manager meets with you to perform a complimentary assessment and answer any questions you may have. While we focus on developing a plan of care that supports the best outcome for your child, we also recognize how important it is to always consider your concerns, home setting, and preferences.</p>
